# What is the FCC?

The [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov) stands for the Federal Communications Commission. It is a United States government agency that was created to regulate communications by cable, satellite, radio, television and wire. The FCC works toward objectives involving these six main areas: broadband; spectrum; homeland security; competition; public safety; modernizing the FCC. The agency is lead by 5 commissioners who are chosen by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. One of those commissioners is selected by the President to be chairman. All commissioners (including the chairman) are supposed to serve only five-year terms. None of the commissioners are supposed to have a financial interest in any commission-related business.

# Chairman of the FCC

  [Ajit Pai](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai?qt-leadership_tabs=0#qt-leadership_tabs) has been involved with the FCC since 2007. He served as a commissioner from 2011 - 2016 and was designated chairman in 2017 by President Donald Trump. Prior to working with the FCC, Pai worked as general counsel for Verizon Communications Inc.

# Mobile wireless

  During the annual FCC analysis of broadband deployment, chairman Ajit Pai claimed that mobile broadband is an acceptable substitute for fiber or cable internet. This statement was made to support the claim that broadband is already being made available to Americans in a timely manner, thus allowing the FCC to reduce steps to promote competition and deployment.

# Why is this important?

  Do you agree with the FCC and Ajit Pai? What if you had to rely on your smartphone for all of your internet needs? This is a reality for a lot of Americans, especially those that live in rural areas. Most cell phone plans charge a premium for using data on their network. This could cost Americans hundreds of dollars for data every month. Most cell networks don't provide internet speeds that are as quick or reliable as a home network. Of course all of this comes on the heels of the FCCâ€™s push to end net neutrality. Why would Ajit claim that smartphones are an adequate substitute for fiber or cable when its clearly not? Remember he is a former Verizon employee, but you can come to your own conclusions. If you disagree with Ajit and the FCC about any of these issues, speak up! Let your voices be heard, contact the FCC, contact your Senators, contact your friends and tell them to do the same.
