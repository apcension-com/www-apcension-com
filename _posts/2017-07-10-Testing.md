## SSH Secret Backend

Name: `ssh`

Vault SSH backend tries to solve the problem of managing access to machine
infrastructure by providing different ways to issue SSH credentials.

The backend issues in 3 types of credentials: CA signed keys, Dynamic keys and
OTP keys. Read and carefully understand all the types before choosing the one
which best suits your needs. In relation to the dynamic key and OTP key type,
the CA key signing is the simplest and most powerful in terms of setup
complexity and in terms of being platform agnostic.

This page will show a quick start for this backend. For detailed documentation
on every path, use `vault path-help` after mounting the backend.

----------------------------------------------------
## I. CA Key Type

When using this type, an SSH CA signing key is generated or configured at the
backend's mount. This key will be used to sign other SSH keys. The private half
of the signing key always stays within Vault and the public half is exposed via
the API. Each mount of this backend represents a unique signing key pair. It is
recommended that the host keys and client keys are signed using different
mounts of this backend.

### Mount a backend's instance for signing host keys

```text
vault mount -path ssh-host-signer ssh
Successfully mounted 'ssh' at 'ssh-host-signer'!
```

### Mount a backend's instance for signing client keys

```text
vault mount -path ssh-client-signer ssh
Successfully mounted 'ssh' at 'ssh-client-signer'!
```
